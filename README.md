# SCT_DS_4
## Traffic Accident Data Analysis
### Overview
This repository contains a project from my Data Science internship at SkillCraft Technology, where I analyzed traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The project also includes visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors to provide insights into the causes of traffic accidents.

### Contents
Jupyter Notebook: The analysis, visualization, and insights are documented in a Jupyter notebook (SCT_DS_4.ipynb).
Dataset: The traffic accident dataset (RTA Dataset.csv) is included in the repository.
### Project Structure
SCT_DS_4.ipynb: This notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
RTA Dataset.csv: The dataset used for the analysis.
### Data Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure the accuracy of the analysis. Key steps included:

Handling Missing Values: Addressing missing or incomplete data to maintain data integrity.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on existing data to enhance analysis, such as categorizing time of day and weather conditions.
Data Transformation: Converting data into a format suitable for analysis, including encoding.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The exploratory data analysis focused on understanding the patterns and relationships in the dataset, including:

Analysis of Road Conditions: Identifying how different road conditions correlate with the frequency and severity of accidents.
Weather Impact: Exploring the effect of various weather conditions on accident occurrences.
Time of Day Analysis: Examining accident patterns across different times of the day and days of the week.
### Visualization
Key visualizations were created to highlight important insights from the data, including:

Contributing Factors: Bar charts, and other visualizations to illustrate the impact of road conditions, weather, and time on accidents.
### Key Findings
The analysis revealed several critical patterns, including the significant impact of weather and road conditions on accident rates, as well as the identification of high-risk time periods and locations. These findings can inform road safety measures and policy decisions.

### How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas).
Open the SCT_DS_4.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to explore the analysis and visualizations.
### Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to traffic accidents, with a focus on road conditions, weather, and time of day. The visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors can help in designing targeted interventions to reduce accident rates.
